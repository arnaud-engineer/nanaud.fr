## Introduction

This awfull thing was my first personnal site. I built it in 2013 when I was in my second year of Computer Science study.

It was not my first one. I started to use web langages in middle school (don't count on me to upload that ðŸ˜‰)

I commit it here for History ðŸ˜‰ (and because I still appreciate this garbage).

## Demo

You can access it at [nanaud.arnaud.cool](https://nanaud.arnaud.cool).

## Licence

This project is under [WTFPL2](https://wtfpl2.com/) licence (except the fonts).
